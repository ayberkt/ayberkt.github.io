My work at Zeroth focuses on interfacing SMT solvers with type-theoretic proof assistants to enable automated proof search.<p>Previously, I was a PhD student in the <a href=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/computer-science/theory-of-computation>Theory of Computation</a> group at the University of Birmingham. I completed my PhD in June 2025 under the supervision of <a href=https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe>Martín Escardó</a>, and with <a href=https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~rahliv>Vincent Rahli</a> as my second supervisor.<p>Before I started my PhD, I obtained an MSc degree from Chalmers University of Technology. For my MSc thesis there, I investigated <a href=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/formal.html>formal topology</a> in the context of univalent type theory, under the supervision of <a href=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/>Thierry Coquand</a>.<h2 id=research>Research</h2><p>Most of my PhD work was focused on making <em>predicative</em> sense of constructive point-free topology in the constructive and predicative context of <a href=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/univalent+type+theory>univalent type theory</a>. Throughout my PhD, my supervisor and I have developed a constructive and predicative development of locale theory in univalent foundations, with a particular focus on the theory of spectral and Stone locales and the point-free topology of domains. This is related to, but different from, formal topology, which is historically the standard way to develop point-free topology predicatively in type theory.<p>More broadly, my primary research interest is the connection <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/.talks/popl2012/escardo-popl2012.pdf#page=24">between topology and computation</a>. Domains and topology are an indispensable tool for approaching this connection, but I am interested in other such tools such as <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066104051357>synthetic topology</a>.
